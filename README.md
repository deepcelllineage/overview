# Overview of DeepCellLineage
The 'overview' repo will hold a general description of the DeepCellLineage group's goal, methods, projects, maintainers, contributors, communication channels, key concepts, FAQs, etc. For more information, please see the READMEs and Wikis of this overview repo and other deepcelllineage project repos. 

## What is DeepCellLineage?
DeepCellLineage is a group of people who are teaching themselves bioinformatics and deep learning by doing projects related to cell biology. 

## Goal
The goal of DeepCellLineage is to find characteristics of cells that may relate to development or progression of cancer, autoimmune, or neurological diseases.

## Methods
1.  Use published bioinformatic methods to label scientific data
2.  Build deep learning models to gain more complex insights into biological interactions (these repo will have the prefix 'dp')

## Projects

### [mitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/mitolin)

- Aim
  - Use standard bioinformatic methods to perform single cell lineage tracing using mitochondrial sequences


### [dpmitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/dpmitolin)

- Aim
    - Use mitochondrial distance labels generated by mitolin as the ground truth to develop a deep learning heirarchical relationship model of single cells

## Join the team
You can join the DeepCellLineage project at any level of commitment. If you are interested please get in touch with the team though any of our communication channels below.

## Communication

### In person (San Francisco, CA, USA)
The best way to join the project is to join us at SF Python's Project Night. Project night is every 3rd Wednesday of the month, 6-9 pm. Check out the [SF Python meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/SFpython/events/) for more info. (Free pizza and drinks are provided.)

You can also find us at the following meetups
  - [PyLadies fastai DLSG, meets every Tuesday, 6-8:30](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/events/)
  - [Bay Bioinformatics Forum, meets once a month](https://www.meetup.com/BayBIFX/events/)
