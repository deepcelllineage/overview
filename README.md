# Overview of DeepCellLineage
The 'overview' repo will hold a general description of the DeepCellLineage group's goal, methods, projects, maintainers, contributors, communication channels, key concepts, FAQs, etc. For more information, please see the READMEs and Wikis of this overview repo and other deepcelllineage project repos. 

## What is DeepCellLineage?
DeepCellLineage is a group of people who are teaching themselves bioinformatics and deep learning by doing projects related to cell biology. 

## Goal
The goal of DeepCellLineage is to find characteristics of cells that may relate to development or progression of cancer, autoimmune, or neurological diseases.

## Methods
1.  Use published bioinformatic methods to label scientific data
2.  Build deep learning models to gain more complex insights into biological interactions (these repo will have the prefix 'dp')

## Projects

### [mitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/mitolin)

- Aim
  - Use standard bioinformatic methods to perform single cell lineage tracing using mitochondrial sequences


### [dpmitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/dpmitolin)

- Aim
    - Use mitochondrial distance labels generated by mitolin as the ground truth to develop a deep learning heirarchical relationship model of single cells
